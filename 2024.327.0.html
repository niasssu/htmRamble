<p>went home and drew an eevee mid-tf for eevee day. guess everyone else thought it was mid too.</p>
<p>nothing reaaly happens around here. family might come for thanksgiving.</p>

<div class="main">
<p>Honestly just want cuddles and whimsy. I want to be able to have fun again. And I have to start by quitting my introspection, and by expressing my thoughts aloud.</p>

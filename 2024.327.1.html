<h3>2024.327.1</h3><p>remembering-school</p>
<hr>
<p>all my life people have called me weird, or assumed i was some sort of genius. the older people, the teachers, they praised me. all the kids ignored me or made fun of me.</p>
<p>i was good in math & science, they thought i was "gifted" because of that. i was gullible, naive. i was 9, i thought it was something to be proud of. it only caused the kids to make fun of me more.</p>
<p>i did stupid things and used the psychic's reading of "adhd/autism" as excuse. shouldn't've done that. psychics are liars anyway. but i didn't know anything about psychiatry, and i was really forced into it anyway. i didn't want to be weird. i wanted to be normal, or at least accepted in some sort of group. i didn't want to be ignored or mocked anymore.</p>
<p>there came a point i couldn't handle it anymore. the pressure to meet the expectations of the system, the pain of being alone. my behaviour worsened, my grades dropped. at some points the things i did simply became a blur.</p>
<p>i kept trying and failing, and every failure was from my inadequacy, my ineptitude. i began to hate myself, i realized that i was inherently defective. there is something wrong with me.</p>
<p>i lost interest in everything i enjoyed, i lost my ability to express my emotions. everything became dull and boring outside the internet. in the span of 4 years, i'd turned from a naive curious child to a depressed untrusting loner. i tried to be as nice as i could to others [it was the only thing i still cared to do] but some days i just couldn't do it, not even to myself.</p>
<p>i wanted other people to be happy, but not me. because i don't deserve happiness.</p>

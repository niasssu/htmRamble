<h3>2024.327.2</h3><p>22-nov-2024</p>
<hr>
<p>i talked about my feelings on <a href="./2024.327.1.html">(.1)</a> to my grandmother. said i need to stop comparing myself to other people's standards and simply define myself in terms of my own. or rather, that's what she was getting at. her actual words would be very different.</p>
</div>
<div class="main">
<p>let's see then. i mainly do things to try and get away from the pain of reality. i do what's familiar to me, or what i think others would like. i want affection. i want social connections.</p>
<p>i can understand concepts with depth, i can do moderate math. i can program webpages, i can cook. i can clean and maintain, i can put things into order. i can plan about two weeks in advance. i do my best to do as i'm told. i spend too much time on these digital devices. i don't have a job, i have no obligations. i live with my grandparents for right now, trying to get myself ready for adulthood.</p>
<p>i can do physical work, i can move stuff, as long as there's someone there to help with the process. i wouldn't necessarily need help with lifting, though i would need some sort of pressure outside myself to keep going.</p>
<p>my native language is english, and i can understand a little bit of the romance languages. i also know a little bit of japanese. i have made up my own language too, called Nezai.</p>
<p>it is a struggle for me to express my thoughts aloud, but i can channel them in text and drawings pretty well i think.</p>
<p>i consume too much media/"content", and don't create enough of my own. i want to make something of my own someday, but i can't ever get the art to align with the idea in my head. someday, hopefully.</p>
<p>but, like any other person, i can do whatever i put my mind to.</p>
</div>
<div class="main">
<p>that's all i can manage tonight. i'll try to make myself useful using what i know about myself.</p>
</div>

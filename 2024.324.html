<hr>
<p>it's been raining all day. was difficult to get up but i'm good now. everyone's busy.</p>
<p>started reading another webcomic. need to make one someday. don't have access to my drawing tablet though.</p>
</div>
<div class="main">
<p>i don't have anything to talk about right now, but i'm tired of just consuming here on the internet. i want to create something of my own.</p>
<p>i haven't shared any of my projects. i haven't actually gotten to making the part i want to show. it's still all in my head.</p>
<p>thinking i'll make the story written, but with a few drawings in between too.</p>
</div>
<div class="main">
<p>there's some sort of music thing with the same name as my made-up species. i didn't know this. but it's too late to change it now.<p>
<p>tbf tho i'm the one stealing the name here. but the ideas aren't even related i came up with the name myself. it's just coincidence i guess.</p>
<p>oh right, i need to create a basic page for them. maybe in the next commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="main">
<p>somehow i fell asleep while drawing in my traditional sketchbook. not stuff i'd want anyone to see.</p>
<p>i'll get back to drawing on digital when i can get my drawing tablet set up again.</p>

<hr>
<p>it's been raining all day. was difficult to get up but i'm good now. everyone's busy.</p>
<p>started reading another webcomic. need to make one someday. don't have access to my drawing tablet though.</p>
</div>
<div class="main">
<p>i don't have anything to talk about right now, but i'm tired of just consuming here on the internet. i want to create something of my own.</p>
<p>i haven't shared any of my projects. i haven't actually gotten to making the part i want to show. it's still all in my head.</p>
<p>thinking i'll make the story written, but with a few drawings in between too.</p>

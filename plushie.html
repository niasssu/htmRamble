<h3>plushie</h3>
<hr>
<p>i hate this human form. no tail, not enough fluffy. because of this form others of the kind expect me to be like them. i do my best but i can't quite get it right.</p>
<p>it feels that i'm not one of them, and this body just generally feels uncomfortable, unbearable. not to mention the urges my headmate has everytime we wanna wake up or go to sleep.</p> 
</div>
<div class="main">
<p>i wanna be a plushie for some time. no expectations, no stresses, just a thing to be loved and love back.</p>
<p>i still wanna think, move, feel, and talk. i just want a more comfortable form. it's not possible to be a living plushie irl though, i know this.</p>
</div>
<div class="main">
<!--<p>maybe i'll get neutered or something. i mean yeah i'm aroace but my headmate gets horny over piss and the body cums. i hate it.</p>
<p>sorry, tmi.<br>it's just,--><p>i want to be fluffy, and lovable, and not be expected to constantly exert myself. i want to be somewhat of a talking pet.</p>
<p>i like the idea of being a living plushie better though. it is much the same in my mind. i just wanna be a cute cuddly stuffed animal.</p>
</div>
<div class="main">
<p>this yearning has been quite strong as of late, though i feel it's something i've felt before.</p>
<p>wait no, this isn't curiosity of what it would be like, this is actually <i>wanting</i> it. i might <i>actually</i> be a plushie therian.<br>
as for the animal.. it doesn't seem to matter, just not human.</p>
</div>
<div class="main">
<p>this would actually solve so much, if i just believe that i already am plushie, just trapped in this form. i don't have to pressure myself to get human things right all the time, because i'm not human.</p>
<p>well, that doesn't mean i shouldn't at least try. i'm in this form, so i have to just deal with it. and there are expectations put on me while i'm in this form, nigh-obligations.</p>
</div>
<div class="main">
<p>there aren't a lot more thoughts coming to mind about this.</p>

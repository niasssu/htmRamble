<hr>
<p>they're just furries. it really doesn't go much further than that.<br>they're furries with advanced tech that was left behind after the maerx left their planet.</p>
<p>the zunej were a bit curious, and they learned to use and modify the technology, and they eventually opened the srocosmu that led them to earth.</p>
</div>
<div class="main">
<p>of course, not all zunej are the furries. the normal ones ["panaj"] are pretty much the same as any other animal.</p>
<p>the furries are called "sacaj".</p>

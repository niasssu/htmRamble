<p>first meaningful commit. git is such a pain to deal with but somehow i keep trying to deal with it.</p>
<p>i don't really have anything to say. i'm ni&amacr;, i'm a furry artist and amateur programmer. sometimes i create stories. some are made by me and some by my headmate. you'll see him post sometimes.</p>
<p>i have a whole bin of lore that i'd like to share someday. not now of course.</p>

<p>if you're curious at all about my other stuff, you can check my <a href="https://niasssu.neocities.org">(neocities)</a> or something. there's a list of where to look for me on [./index].</p>
<p>i also have some other public projects here, those being <a href="https://niasssu.github.io/loa">(a TF dropdown)</a> and <a href="https://niasssu.github.io/brwsrTxtEditr">(a browser-based text editor)</a>.</p>
<p>i guess this is just going to be a blog if i can manage to use it enough. if i can't, well, try to find me wherever i am.</p>

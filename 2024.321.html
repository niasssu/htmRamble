<p>first meaningful commit. git is such a pain to deal with but somehow i keep trying to deal with it.</p>
<p>i don't really have anything to say. i'm ni&amacr;, i'm a furry artist and amateur prorammer. sometimes i create stories. some are made by me and some by my headmate. you'll see him post sometimes.</p>
<p>i have a whole bin of lore that i'd like to share someday. not now of course.</p>

<p>first meaningful commit. git is such a pain to deal with but somehow i keep trying to deal with it.</p>
<p>i don't really have anything to say. i'm ni&amacr;, i'm a furry artist and amateur programmer. sometimes i create stories. some are made by me and some by my headmate. you'll see him post sometimes.</p>
<p>i have a whole bin of lore that i'd like to share someday. not now of course.</p>
</div>
<div class="main">
<p>if you're curious at all about my other stuff, you can check my <a href="https://niasssu.neocities.org">(neocities)</a> or something. there's a list of where to look for me on [./index].</p>
<p>i also have some other public projects here, those being <a href="https://niasssu.github.io/loa">(a TF dropdown)</a> and <a href="https://niasssu.github.io/brwsrTxtEditr">(a browser-based text editor)</a>.</p>
<p>i guess this is just going to be a blog if i can manage to use it enough. if i can't, well, try to find me wherever i am.</p>

<div class="main">
<p>alright, alright. you want a proper profile. i'll try to condense my info into simple bulletpoints.</p>
<ul style="text-align:left;">
    <li>username is niasssu. my handle is normally niassu, and the displayname will normally be some variation of ni&amacr;. i will not share my truename.</li>
    <li>i draw sometimes. you won't see any of that here, check my socials or neocities to see what i'm comfortable sharing.</li>
    <li>i program in HTML, CSS, and JS. I also know a little bit of BASH, but I didn't really get anything out of learning it so i stopped.</li>
    <li>i have a conworld. the thing i've worked on most - too much, even - is a conlang called Nezai. you won't be seeing the whole dictionary, just a few words if i use them.</li>
    <li>my sona ayra is a zune, one of the various acari animals in my conworld. see <a href="https://niasssu.neocities.org/abt/ay.htm">(neocities/abt/ay.htm)</a> for more info about them.</li>
    <li>irl i am a male human. age is 19, and i'm plural. my headmate's name is euio /ɛʊ.jo/ . he has very little presence on the internet, i do not plan on giving him his own account.</li>
    <li>i was diagnosed with a sort of neuron problem - specifically aspbergers/audhd - back in elementary school, and my family is gullible enough to believe it. yes i was in the gifted program, because apparently getting good grades is "abnormal".</li>
    <li>i learned to use MS Powerpoint 2007 around 2010~2011. that was my first introduction to digital computers, really. had an iPad at 6, got a cellphone at 9. this combination will not end well.</li>
    <li>i got a GED on 2023-NOV-30, after dropping out 12th grade. the work was overwhelming, but boring at the same time. i just didn't wanna do it. did the GED in like a month and passed first try.</li>
    <li>the only real hobbies keeping me going are drawing, programming, and a few games. the internet too i guess, it's practically where i live now, to fail at escaping the pain of the real world.</li>
    <li>i live in the states, the eastern timezone. due to daylight savings, i may be UTC-5 or -4. i don't know, and i don't really care bc it doesn't affect me at all.</li>
    <li>i have no job, i can't manage to wake up in the morning. nor can i go to sleep at a reasonable time. if things get worse i probably will lie to the government to get ssdi. but they're reading this, aren't they?</li>
    <li>i'm an aroace only child. yeah actual "end of the bloodline" scenario. too bad i'm not in a position to make it epic.</li>
    <li>my projects are scattered all over the place, most are private.</li>
</ul>
<p>i wrote more than i thought i would.</p>

<hr>
<p>headmate woke me up this morning. it hurt but i forgive. he can't really control it.</p>
<p>went to the strip mall today. mostly just looked through the windows as i walked the whole thing. then i saw a shopping cart out in the parking lot, and as i was taking it back i had this vivid daydream:</p>
</div>
<div class="main dark">
<p>You open your eyes and find yourself standing in an empty parking lot that seems to stretch endlessly. There are no buildings, nor any cars to be seen. The only other things you see are the clouds in the sky and a shopping cart next to you. It goes to a store you can't decipher the name of.<br>
You can feel, almost hear a sort of obligation to take it to wherever that store is. You grab the handle and roll it in a direction. The empty parking lot continues for what must be miles. Who designed this horrible place.</p>
</div>
<div class="main">
<p>other than that nothing too interesting happened today. played digimon tcg at a store across the river and lost horribly. this is why i stuck to just one...</p>
